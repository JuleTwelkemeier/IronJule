For example if you would sort the data in the table actor by last_name, you would see that there is Christian Arkoyd, Kirsten Arkoyd, and Debbie Arkoyd. These three actors have the same last name. So we do not want to include this last name in our output. Last name \"Astaire\" is present only one time with actor \"Angelina Astaire\", hence we would want this in our output list. "
